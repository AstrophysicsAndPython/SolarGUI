# SolarGUI

A program which contains information about the solar system planets, moon, pluto, Sun, and more.

## What it is?

The SolarGUI is a fun little project aimed to gather planetary (and other) information. See the values of various
physical parameters in standard (SI, CGS) and some fun units as well.

## How to install?

The SolarGUI is available via `pip`. Simply use the command,

`pip install SolarGUI`

Once the SolarGUI has been installed, you can simply launch it from the terminal/installation environment via,

The frontend of SolarGUI provides several buttons for different planets.

6. surface area, and
7. surface gravity.

The dropdown menus will show various other (standard and non-standard) units of measures.

## TODO

- [ ] Add a comparison button/dropdown menu to check the values with respect to Earth/Jupiter/Sun.
- [ ] Segregate moons, dwarf planets, planets and other type of celestial objects.
- [ ] Design adjustments of the GUI
- [ ] Separate button/menu for physical/orbital and other parameters.
- [ ] Some interesting plots (optional).
- [ ] Random facts button.
- [ ] Add citations
- [ ] Add a section of papers that study different properties of the celestial objects.
- [ ] Add more sensible units
